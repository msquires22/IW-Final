            <h1>College Athlete Connect: Our Story</h1>
            <p>
                College Athlete Connect was founded on the belief that every high school athlete deserves the
                opportunity to continue their sport in college. For most aspiring athletes, the problem is not a
                willingness to do the work, but finding the right coaches to bring them to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up in a rural town in Upstate NY, I was hard-pressed finding wrestling coaches to elevate me to
                the level of a D1 recruit. Our only solution was my father leaving straight from work, driving me an
                hour in each direction to practice four nights a week, depriving me of time with my mother and sister at
                home. Many of my teammates were forced to do the same thing. With the countless sacrifices already made
                to be a high level athlete, this is not one that should have to be made.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I am on the opposite side, a college student-athlete strapped for cash, I would love to give
                back to the community that gave so much to me. But for someone looking to coach, there is no way to find
                clients without handling the marketing yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                College Athlete Connect serves as a two way solution. Any athlete in need of a coach can find one. And
                any athlete looking to coach can find a client. We handle the rest. We will continue growing to serve
                the greatest number of athletes possible, and make collegiate athletics accessible to everyone.
